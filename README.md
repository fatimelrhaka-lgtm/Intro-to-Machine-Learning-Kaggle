# Introduction to Machine Learning

This project demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts using Python, including:

- Data loading and basic exploration
- Feature selection
- Training a first machine learning model
- Model validation and evaluation

The notebook was developed as part of the Kaggle *Introduction to Machine Learning* course and reflects practical application of supervised learning workflows using scikit-learn.
